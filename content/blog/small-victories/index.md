As mentioned in yesterday's entry, today I focused on making this blog site my own.  I did away with the generic WordPress theme and styled the site to how I've envisioned the final product.

The hurdles I faced today proved that I have much to learn as a web developer.  At times I was discouraged, but my persistence led me to success.  I have now reached a point where I am highly satisfied with the flow of this blog site.

If physics has taught me anything that translates to software development, it is that learning is <em>not</em> always easy.  Swimming toward the metaphorical deep-end of user interface design has proven challenging, but the satisfaction of success was well worth the effort.
