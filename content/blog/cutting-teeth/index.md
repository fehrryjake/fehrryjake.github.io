The purpose of this blog site is to document my experience learning about user interface design with React.  Today's work was focused around getting a skeleton of this site off the ground and hosted locally on my machine.  This was done using <a style = "color: #f1d191" href = 'https://www.gatsbyjs.org/'>Gatsby</a>, a static site generator built on React.

Although the off-the-shelf styling of the site is clean (by default it uses WordPress), I intend to make it my own over the coming days.  Despite having previous CSS experience, the purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the React framework-- for this reason I plan to use inline styling techniques as opposed to importing a traditional CSS style sheet.
